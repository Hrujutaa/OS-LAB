--Operating Systems Lab (4th Semester)

This repository contains programs and concepts implemented as part of the **Operating Systems Lab** coursework. The lab focuses on understanding core operating system concepts, process scheduling algorithms, and Linux/Ubuntu terminal commands.



--Topics Covered

Ubuntu Terminal & Basic Command Line

Hands-on practice with Linux (Ubuntu) terminal commands:

* `pwd` – Print working directory
* `ls` – List files and directories
* `cd` – Change directory
* `mkdir` – Create directory
* `nano` / `vim` – Text editing

📌 Gained understanding of:

* Linux file system structure
* User permissions
* Process management basics



 2️⃣ CPU Scheduling Algorithms

Implemented and analyzed different CPU scheduling techniques:

 🔹 First Come First Serve (FCFS)

* Non-preemptive scheduling
* Processes executed in order of arrival
* Simple but may cause long waiting time

 🔹 Shortest Job First (SJF)

* Non-preemptive scheduling
* Process with smallest burst time executed first
* Minimizes average waiting time

🔹 Round Robin (RR)

* Preemptive scheduling
* Fixed time quantum assigned to each process
* Fair CPU allocation among processes

Calculated:

* Waiting Time
* Turnaround Time
* Average Waiting Time
* Average Turnaround Time

-- Additional Operating System Concepts Covered

As part of the 4th semester curriculum:

* Introduction to Operating Systems
* Types of Operating Systems
* Process & Process States
* Process Control Block (PCB)
* Inter-Process Communication (IPC)
* Threads & Multithreading
* Deadlocks (Conditions, Prevention & Avoidance)
* Memory Management
* Paging & Segmentation
* Virtual Memory
* File System Basics
* System Calls
* Synchronization (Critical Section Problem)

 --Technologies Used

* C Programming Language
* GCC Compiler
* Ubuntu Linux
* Terminal / Shell

 --Learning Outcomes

* Developed practical knowledge of Linux environment
* Understood core OS concepts through implementation
* Gained experience in CPU scheduling algorithms
* Improved problem-solving and system-level programming skills

--Conclusion

This lab strengthened foundational knowledge of operating systems and provided hands-on experience in implementing scheduling algorithms and working in a Linux environment.
